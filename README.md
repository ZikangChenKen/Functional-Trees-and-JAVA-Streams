# Functional-Trees-and-JAVA-Streams
In this repo, we provide you with an implementation of generic functional trees, similar to the GList generic functional lists used in lectures and Lab 2. This implementation can be found in provided/trees.

Meanwhile, we have provided you with a database of Products, Orders, and Customers. Customers can place multiple orders and each order can contain a number of products with varying discounts. All the information is already loaded for you in the code we have provided, and is inside 3 Java collections: CustomerRepo, OrderRepo, and ProductRepo.
